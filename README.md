# ExcelToObject

This API is used for converting an sheet in an excel file into an JSON object.
The API comes with Swagger, but since Swagger doesn't support multipart and file upload, I recommend testing this API with Postman.  
This repo contains an excel test file.
You can use this file with the following parameters:

```
ExcelConfig = [{"ColName": "test1", "ColIndex": 0}, {"ColName": "test2", "ColIndex": 1}, {"ColName": "test3", "ColIndex": 2}, {"ColName": "test4", "ColIndex": 3}]
ExcelSheetName = test
```
